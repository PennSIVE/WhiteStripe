Title: Whitestripe White Matter Normalization For Magnetic Resonance Images
Version: 1.1
Date: 2015-05-22
Author: Taki Shinohara, John Muschelli
Maintainer: John Muschelli <muschellij2@gmail.com>
Description: Whitestripe normalization from Shinohara et. al does
        intensity-based normalization of T1 and T2 images, where normal
        appearing white matter performs well, but requires segmentation.
        This method performs white matter mean and standard deviation
        estimates on data that has been rigidly-registered to the MNI
        template and uses histogram-based methods.
