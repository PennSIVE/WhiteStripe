Title: White Matter Normalization for Magnetic Resonance Images using
    Whitestripe
Version: 1.1.3
Date: 2016-05-31
Author: Taki Shinohara, John Muschelli
Maintainer: John Muschelli <muschellij2@gmail.com>
Description: Shinohara et. al introduced Whitestripe, an
    intensity-based normalization of T1 and T2 images, where normal
    appearing white matter performs well, but requires segmentation.
    This method performs white matter mean and standard deviation
    estimates on data that has been rigidly-registered to the MNI
    template and uses histogram-based methods.
